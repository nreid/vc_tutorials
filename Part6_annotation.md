# Variant annotation

## Introduction

This section of the tutorial deals with annotating variants.  It assumes you have completed Parts 2, 4a/b and 5 so that you have 3 VCF files from each of the three variant calling approaches in the directory structure established in the tutorial. 

Steps here will use the following software packages:

- []()
- []()

Each major step below has an associated bash script tailored to the UConn CBC Xanadu cluster with appropriate headers for the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job scheduler. The code can easily be modified to run interactively, or in other contexts.

## Connecting variants with existing databases

The final thing we'll cover in this tutorial is variant annotation. In this context, annotation means two things:
1. Connect the variants we've discovered to knowledge about them in existing databases. 
2. Make some predictions about the functional impact of the variants based on our genome annotation.
